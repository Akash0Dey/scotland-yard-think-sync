# Scotland Yard

## Description Of Project

Scotland Yard is a strategic board game set in London. One player takes on the role of Mister X, a mysterious criminal who moves secretly around the city. The other players act as detectives working together to track him down. Players use different forms of transport—taxis, buses, and the underground—to move around the board. The detectives must cooperate and plan carefully to corner Mister X, while he uses stealth and clever moves to avoid capture. The game challenges players’ teamwork, logic, and strategy.
