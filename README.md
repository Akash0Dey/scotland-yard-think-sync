**Scotland Yard** is a turn-based strategy game where:

- 🎭 One player takes the role of **Mr.X**, a fugitive moving in secret across
  London.

  location.

  **underground**—to travel the map.
- 💡 The game emphasizes **critical thinking**, **team coordination**, and
  **anticipation** of your opponent’s moves.
